# linear_algebra_from_scratch
Linear Algebra for Machine Learning  This repository contains step-by-step solutions of important linear algebra concepts with both mathematical explanations (formulas &amp; theory) and Python/NumPy implementations.  The goal is to bridge theory and practice, making it easier to understand how linear algebra powers Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
