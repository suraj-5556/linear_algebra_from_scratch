Write a Python function that calculates the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix. The function should return a list containing the eigenvalues, sort values from highest to lowest.

Example:
Input:
matrix = [[2, 1], [1, 2]]
Output:
[3.0, 1.0]
Reasoning:
The eigenvalues of the matrix are calculated using the characteristic equation of the matrix, which for a 2x2 matrix is 
λ^2-trace(a)+det(a)=0, where 
λ
λ are the eigenvalues.
